## Frequently asked questions

#### What is UCoMP?

From the [instrument page] for UCoMP:

> The Upgraded Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (UCoMP) is a 20-cm aperture Lyot coronagraph with a Stokes polarimeter and a narrow-band electro-optically tuned birefringent filter. It can image the intensity, full Stokes polarization, Doppler shift and line width across coronal emission lines in the visible and near-IR.
