; Routine to resolve a given routine without crashing.
;
; :Examples:
;   For example, try::
;
;     IDL> mg_resolve_routine, 'mg_src_root', resolved=resolved, /either
;     IDL> help, resolved
;     RESOLVED        BYTE      =    1
;     IDL> mg_resolve_routine, 'mg_fake_routine', resolved=resolved, /either
;     IDL> help, resolved
;     RESOLVED        BYTE      =    0
;
;   Note that `RESOLVE_ROUTINE` would have crashed in the second call to
;   `MG_RESOLVE_ROUTINE`.
;
; :Params:
;   routine : in, required, type=string
;     name of routine to resolve
;
; :Keywords:
;   resolved : out, optional, type=boolean
;     set to a named variable to find out if the routine was resolved
;   _extra : in, optional, type=keywords
;     keywords to `RESOLVE_ROUTINE`
