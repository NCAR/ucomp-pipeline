This is the API documentation for the UCoMP pipeline, the code responsible for
ingesting level 0 UCoMP files and producing higher level products, including the
the level 1 and level 2 products, as well as engineering products to monitor the
instrument.

Besides the IDL code found in subdirectories of the `src` directory enumerated
below, there are several other directories used heavily by the pipeline.

The `bin` directory contains executable scripts that run the pipeline and
perform other maintenance tasks. The `ucomp` script, created from `ucomp.in`,
is the primary way of running the pipeline, filtering the log, displaying
information from a FITS file, and many other tasks. The entry points in the
IDL source code that are called directly from the `ucomp` scripts end in
"_wrapper.pro" and take `date` and `config_filename` as arguments::

  src/calibrate/ucomp_calibration_wrapper.pro
  src/distribute/ucomp_l0_archive_wrapper.pro
  src/distribute/ucomp_l1_archive_wrapper.pro
  src/distribute/ucomp_l2_archive_wrapper.pro
  src/distribute/ucomp_archive_wrapper.pro
  src/eod/ucomp_eod_check_wrapper.pro
  src/eod/ucomp_eod_wrapper.pro
  src/realtime/ucomp_realtime_wrapper.pro
  src/reprocess/ucomp_clearday_wrapper.pro
  src/reprocess/ucomp_reprocess_wrapper.pro
  src/validate/ucomp_validate_file_wrapper.pro

The `config` directory contains the specification for the config file that
controls the options for running the pipeline. Config files that follow this
spec are also placed in the installation from this directory. These config
files provide necessary information such as where to find the raw files and
options such as how to combine cameras or whether to update the database.

The `gen` directory contains routines that are generally useful for MLSO
instrument pipelines.

The `lib` directory contains more general library routines not written by MLSO.

The `resource` directory contains non-source code files used by the pipeline:
distortion correction coefficients, demodulation coefficients, the epochs file,
information about the wave regions, database table specifications, color
tables, hot pixel locations, file validation specifications, and logo images.

The `ssw` directory contains SolarSoft routines needed for the pipeline. Only
the routines necessary for the pipeline are included and are not automatically
updated so that the pipeline does not break if SolarSoft is updated.
