A guide to the UCoMP products produced by the UCoMP pipeline.

## Dynamics files


## Polarization files

Polarization files have filenames of the form:

    YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS.ucomp.WWWW.l2.polarization.fts

where `YYYYMMDD` and `HHMMSS` are the UT time of the observation and `WWWW` is the wave region, e.g. "780" or 1074".

The extensions of a polarization file are:

1. Average intensity
2. Enhanced average intensity
3. Average Q
4. Average U
5. Average log(L)
6. Azimuth
7. Radial azimuth

How is intensity computed?
