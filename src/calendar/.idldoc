Routines for handling dates/times, in particular, converting between different
representations of a date/time.

The representations of date/times are: `DATE-OBS` format "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS";
observing day hours, i.e., 7.5 represents 7:30 am in the observing day; Julian
day; and a short form "YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS". Each of these formats are used in
different situations and routines to convert between them are needed.

It is also necessary to convert between UT and HST time zones. Observations are
recorded in UT, but HST is more convenient when a continuous hour is needed
because UT time crosses midnight in our observing day.
